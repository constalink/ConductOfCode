# Conduct Of Code

This project was created to maintain coding standards for [Constalink](https://constalink.com)

All Constalink developers must adhere to these coding standards. These coding standards are generic by nature and apply
to all programming languages.

**NOTE** Constalink coding standards are *Always Current* and are version independent. All code submitted in any file
to any repository MUST follow proper coding standards at the time of submission or it will be rejected. If you are
updating an existing file, the file must be brought up to date in order to be accepted. We may consider exceptions to
this rule on a per case basis, but generally, code that does not follow standards will be rejected.
